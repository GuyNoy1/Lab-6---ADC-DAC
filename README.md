# Lab-6---ADC-DAC
The last lab in the Introduction to Computers course used ADC/DAC 12&10. In this lab, theoretical questions were asked about the MSP430x4xx family processors, and the practical assignment was on the MSP430G2553 processor.

During the assignment, we used the ADC 10 to complete three missions:

When pressing push button number 0, we needed to sample an input signal with amplitude of 0-Vcc, frequency of 1-1000 Hz, and dynamically identify it as a sinusoidal, pulse width modulation (PWM), or triangular signal, and display the result on the LCD screen.

When pressing push button number 1, we needed to sample the same input as above and dynamically display the average voltage on the LCD screen.

When pressing push button number 2, we needed to sample the same input as above and produce an output PWM signal with a value of '1' when the absolute value of the input signal derivative is larger than 2, and '0' otherwise.
